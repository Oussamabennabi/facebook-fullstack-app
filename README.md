## if you like the project please leave a ‚≠ê it will mean a lot to me. 


## Note:
#### im so sory for the server response time im living in algeria and the ping here is so bad also since im using "multer" to upload images and videos to the server but heroku does not like that. you need a subscription to enable that and of course as you guessed it you can't have visa card in algeria üò¥.

peace.
